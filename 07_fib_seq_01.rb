# A slightly different kind of challenge this morning.

# The Company has broken the keyboard on their one and only laptop, so canâ€™t get this bit of code to run. What would the output of this code be (without running it on your own computer)? 

 def fib(num)
  if num < 2
     num
  else
     fib(num-1) + fib(num-2)
  end
end
puts fib(4)

#the code would error out due to line 1 having an '_' when it is expecting an ")"
#with the code corrected, the code should output the finichi code by the loop starting with 0 then subtracting 1 then 2 from it as stated by line 5
#then adds 4 to the output as stated by line 8
